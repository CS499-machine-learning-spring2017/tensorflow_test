# tensorflow_test

This repository contains 2 files:
1) random_data_generator.py
2) softmax_test.py

Both of these files are written for python 3.5

Random_data_generator will ask for the number of data points you want to create. 
Give it a large number and it will create "test_data.csv" for you.

After you've created "test_data.csv", you can run softmax_test.py, which is an
implementation of the softmax algorithm outlined here: 
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/#implementing_the_regression

Currently the results are not as good as I would like, but I will try to troubleshoot later this week.
